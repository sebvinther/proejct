# Project
In the following project i have made the choice to focus on stock analysis, with the viewpoint thta news regarding the stock has an affection on the stock price. Therefore i have chosen the stock, Nvidia, to collect data from an API service called Alpha Vantage, which provides a free and easy to use service (the paid ones are often better in my opinion). To collect the news I have used a free website called Polygon.io. The reason behind the use of news comes from the importance of sentiment regarding the firm in focus. A bad newspaper can affect the stockprice in some cases. Furthermore, LSTM was the choice of use, because of its known attributes when it comes to stock predictions.

In conclusion there could have been made diffent choices to increase the models chance of predicting the right price.
